<section><title>TypEr 0.9</title>

  <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>
    <list>
      <item>
	<p>
	  Major rewrite; all code has been cleaned up and placed in
	  one file.  The only reason why this is not version 1.0 yet
	  is that there is no proper documentation.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
	<p>
	  Added ability to receive the set of exported types and
	  report unknown ones.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
	<p>
	  Added two undocumented options that may come very handy when
	  trying to understand why typer reports some particular set
	  of types for the functions in a module. These options are
	  mainly for typer developers at this point, but may become
	  documented in some future version.</p>

  <section><title>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</title>

	  Better handling of overloaded contracts; especially
	  erroneous ones on which typer does not crash anymore.</p>
      </item>
      <item>
        <p>
	  Fixed problem that caused typer to hang when given a file
	  whose module name did not correspond to the file name.</p>
